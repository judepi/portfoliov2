        <p>
           I began my degree at CUNY Queens College in 2021, where I took various
          theoretical and practical courses in computer science. While my
          coursework provided a solid foundation, I pursued web development
          independently and gained the skills needed to build full-stack
          applications. Additionally, I have grown my expertise in different tech domains through online resources such as courses and programs.
